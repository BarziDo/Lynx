A simple perceptron in python for educatives purposes.

# Readme
Hi Barzi, i'm now writing for you a little documentation with the functioning of a perceptron, after we both can enhace this project in a very best thing, but for now, this is what we have.

# Perceptron
What i was saying, the first step to start the project is develop a perceptron.
A perceptron is a model of neuron for a IA, the perceptron have two inputs and one ouput, and another parts what i explain after, in python, i'm thinking in use a OOP how paradigm, is very usefull for these cases.
In general, you can see the model in the next image:

Do not panic! Hahaha, it is simpler than it looks, it is the model of a complex perceptron A.K.A multilayer perceptron. The diference between the multilayer perceptron and the simple perceptron are the number of inputs and weights, a simple perceptron has only two inputs, and one weight for each input, and the multilayer has more than two inputs/weights.
The weight is the matter of a input, you can see it how a... In the icecream, it matters more the flavor than the color, for a IA, the flavor has more weight than the color, can you understand? The input is only a value, this input can be added by any way, for example, the camera, the input of a shell, and a lot of other cases.
Another elements of the model are the transfer function and the activation function, one each time:
