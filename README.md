# Readme
Hi Barzi, i'm now writing for you a little documentation with the functioning of a perceptron, after we both can enhace this project in a very best thing, but for now, this is what we have.

# Perceptron
What i was saying, the first step to start the project is develop a perceptron.
A perceptron is a model of neuron for a IA, the perceptron have two inputs and one ouput, and another parts what i explain after, in python, i'm thinking in use a OOP how paradigm, is very usefull for these cases.
In general, you can see the model in the next image:
